# Agent Guidelines

Follow these rules when working on this repository:

- **Respect dual IRIs**: preserve both canonical and alternate IRIs when editing.
- **Keep OWL and SKOS in sync**: update parallel ontology representations together.
- **Run `pnpm test` before submitting pull requests**.
- **Avoid cross-module edits**: confine changes to a single module at a time.
